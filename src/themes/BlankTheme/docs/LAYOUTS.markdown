# Available Layouts

The available layouts are supported by the body templates, located at the _/templates/body_ subfolder, and are as follows:

## 2 colums (2col)

Supports all the available two column distributions, the main column at the left or right, with one of the side columns with the left/right blockpositions (by default).

## 3 columns (3col)

Supports all the available two column distributions, the main column at the left or right, with one of the side columns with the left/right blockpositions (by default).

## 3 columns (3col231)

Supports the classic three column distributions, with the main column at the middle, switching the side columns, allowing to use borders on the main column `#col1_content`.

## Subtemplates (grid)

As an example of [YAML subtemplates](http://www.yaml.de/en/documentation/practice/subtemplates.html) there is a example of its use, with the main column at the left, taking the 60% of the total width, and the side columns the other 40%.

## Full width (fullwidth)

Is the same 2col except for the multiple use of the containers .page_margins and .page to fill all the width.
